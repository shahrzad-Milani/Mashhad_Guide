        deep reddish-brown color as a drink that paves the way for socializing,
        fatigue relief, and also served during breakfast in Iran. It is mostly
        served with a sugar cube. It is an interesting activity to learn how to
        drink tea while you keep the sugar cube in your mouth. Don’t forget to
        try it! Sometimes Iranians flavored their tea with pieces of Persian
        dried lime (limu Omani), dried bitter orange, or a piece of cinnamon
        stick. Sugar cube, rock candy, and different kinds of dates are the main
        companions of tea in Iran. It is traditionally served in glass cups
        saucers since tea lovers believe that they should see the color of tea
        while drinking it!

            All things you should know about alcohol in Iran:
        </h2>
        <img src="images/alcohol.jpg" alt="alcohol" />
        <pre>
          Is alcohol prohibited in Iran? The answer is definite YES! Consuming,
          buying, and selling alcoholic drinks are illegal inside the borders of
          Iran. Hence, there is no bar or liquor shop inside Iran providing
          alcohol. As a tourist, there is no exception for using alcohol in
          Iran. It is a law in the country, which banned drinking, buying, and
          selling alcohol in this land for everyone. Maybe you heard about the
          myth that hotels and cafes in Iran provide alcohol for foreigners. It
          is not true! There is no place that you can order alcohol in this
          country. As you may see bringing or drinking alcohol is illegal as it
          may result in some punishment in Iran. So do not disregard this law
          while staying in Iran! Like other illegal products, you may find some
          alcoholic drinks produced or smuggled in Iran. Besides the legal
          consequence, these products may threaten your health. So it is better
          to plan for an alcohol-free vacation while traveling the country!
